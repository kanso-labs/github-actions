- **Keys in JSON and YAML are ordered by name.** Files whose order carries
  meaning are exempt: workflows, where step order is execution order;
  changelogs, which are chronological; and `package.json`, where the npm
  ecosystem expects `name` and `version` first.
- **A workflow's filename is the kebab-case of its `name:` field.** Reusable
  workflows, meaning those triggered only by `workflow_call`, take a leading
  underscore.
- **Job names and step names are imperative verb phrases.** Job ids, step ids,
  and matrix keys are exempt.
- **Actions are pinned to exact release tags**, `actions/checkout@v7.0.1`, never
  a moving major or `@main`. Renovate opens the bump pull requests.
- **Dependency versions are pinned exactly.** Every `dependencies`,
  `devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies` entry is a bare version,
  `1.2.3`, never `^1.2.3`, `~1.2.3`, `>=1.2.3`, `*`, `1.x`, or an `||` union.
  Renovate opens those bumps too. `peerDependencies` are the deliberate
  exception: they state what the consumer's own installed copy must satisfy, so
  ranges are correct there and stay.
- **`.tool-versions` pins a fully-specified version on every line**,
  `nodejs 24.19.0`, never `nodejs 24` or `nodejs lts`.
